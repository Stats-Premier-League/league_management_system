# LEAGUE CLEAN SHEET CALCULATOR CLASS 
# Main Purpose: To define the CleanSheetCalculator class and its associated
# data structures. This class is specialized in computing defensive statistics,
# primarily the number of clean sheets (matches played without conceding a goal)
# for both the teams and individual goalkeepers within a given season.
# It also includes a utility function to mark clean sheets on a match record itself.
